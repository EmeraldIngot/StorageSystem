# StorageSystem

A Minecraft plugin that implements a simple storage system inspired by [Deep Storage Plus](https://github.com/christopherwalkerml/DeepStoragePlus), which is also similar to that of [Applied Energestics 2](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2)

# Bugs
I have tested this plugin for duplication glitches, item loss bugs, and other issues as much as I could, but there are no doubt edge cases that I forgot.

If you find any problems at all, please open an issue so that I can fix them.
